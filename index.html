    <p style="font-family:timesnewroman;"> Why I created this website: This is the website I made displaying my acheivements in AP Computer Science Principles and Photography 1-2. In CSP, we had to create projects such as making games with user input while also using the turtle feature to draw cool images. In the Photography Portfolio App, it contains another webpage all my favorite photos I took throughout the course. </p>
